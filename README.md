# Kyochon 
I have replicated the existing Kyochon app https://www.kyochon.com/main/
The existing app was not responsive so I have made this app responsive to fit for different screen sizes.

## 1 Git clone our repo
First click <> Code green button<br>
Then copy URL then open up your local CLI<br>
Type in "git clone <copied_url>" then press enter to create a local repo<br>
(a local copy of our remote repo)

## 2 Put in your API key at top of index.html
Get your Javascript API key from kakao devleopers and replace with API KEY in <br><script type="text/javascript" src="//dapi.kakao.com/v2/maps/sdk.js?appkey=APIKEY"></script><br>at top section of index html
